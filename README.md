Send files using tus client in react

1 / 2


To send files using the tus client in a React application, you can follow these steps:

Install the tus-js-client library by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
npm install tus-js-client
Import the tus library in your component file:
javascript
Copy code
import tus from 'tus-js-client';
Create a function that will handle the upload process. This function should create a new tus client instance and then use the upload method to upload the file. Here's an example of what this function might look like:
javascript
Copy code
function handleUpload(file) {
  const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
    endpoint: 'https://your-upload-endpoint.com/files',
    retryDelays: [0, 1000, 3000, 5000],
    metadata: {
      filename: file.name,
      filetype: file.type
    },
    onError: function(error) {
      console.log('Upload error: ' + error);
    },
    onProgress: function(bytesUploaded, bytesTotal) {
      const percentage = (bytesUploaded / bytesTotal * 100).toFixed(2);
      console.log(bytesUploaded, bytesTotal, percentage + '%');
    },
    onSuccess: function() {
      console.log('Upload finished:', upload.file.name);
    }
  });

  upload.start();
}
Add an input element to your React component that allows the user to select a file to upload. You can use the onChange event to call the handleUpload function when a file is selected. Here's an example of what this might look like:
javascript
Copy code
function MyComponent() {
  const handleFileSelect = (event) => {
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    handleUpload(file);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" onChange={handleFileSelect} />
    </div>
  );
}
That's it! With these steps, you should now be able to upload files using the tus client in your React application.

Install tus server in python file

2 / 2


To install the tus server in Python, you can use the tuspy library, which is a Python implementation of the tus protocol. Here are the steps to install and set up tus server using tuspy:

Install tuspy: You can install tuspy using pip by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
pip install tuspy
Import tuspy: In your Python file, import tuspy as follows:

arduino
Copy code
import tuspy
Create a TusServer instance: Create an instance of TusServer by passing in the path where you want to store the uploaded files:

arduino
Copy code
tus_server = tuspy.TusServer('/path/to/your/uploads')
Define a handler function: You need to define a function that will handle the HTTP requests sent to your tus server. This function will receive the HTTP request object and should return an HTTP response object. Here's an example handler function:

python
Copy code
def handler(request):
    return tus_server.handle_request(request)
Run the server: Finally, you can use any WSGI server to run your tus server. Here's an example using the built-in Python WSGI server:

python
Copy code
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server

with make_server('', 8000, handler) as httpd:
    print("Serving on port 8000...")
    httpd.serve_forever()
This will start a tus server that listens on port 8000. You can now use any tus client to upload files to your server.
