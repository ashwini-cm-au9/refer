API with aiohttp_tus


Ashwini CM
Api with routes using aiohttp_tus with complete code

Sure! Here's an example of how to use aiohttp_tus to create an API with routes for uploading and downloading files using the Tus protocol:

python
Copy code
import asyncio
import aiohttp
from aiohttp import web
import aiohttp_tus


async def upload(request):
    """Handle file uploads using the Tus protocol."""
    app = request.app
    tus_upload_path = '/uploads/'  # The endpoint for Tus uploads
    tus_store_path = '/data/'  # The directory where uploaded files will be stored

    # Initialize the Tus server
    tus_server = aiohttp_tus.Server(app, tus_upload_path, tus_store_path)

    # Handle the request
    response = await tus_server.handle_request(request)
    return response


async def download(request):
    """Handle file downloads."""
    app = request.app
    file_path = '/data/file.txt'  # The path to the file to download

    # Serve the file
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        response = web.StreamResponse()
        response.content_type = 'application/octet-stream'
        response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename="file.txt"'
        await response.prepare(request)

        while True:
            chunk = f.read(1024)
            if not chunk:
                break
            await response.write(chunk)

        return response


app = web.Application()

# Add the routes for uploading and downloading files
app.add_routes([web.post('/uploads/', upload), web.get('/download/', download)])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    web.run_app(app)
In this example, upload handles file uploads using the Tus protocol. The tus_upload_path variable specifies the endpoint where Tus uploads will be handled, and the tus_store_path variable specifies the directory where uploaded files will be stored.

download handles file downloads. The file_path variable specifies the path to the file to be downloaded. The file is served using the web.StreamResponse class, which allows the file to be streamed in chunks to the client.

Finally, app.add_routes adds the upload and download routes to the application.

Note that this example assumes that the Tus client will be sending the Upload-Length header to specify the length of the file being uploaded. If the client does not send this header, aiohttp_tus will not be able to handle the upload.



from a React client using the fetch API:

javascript
Copy code
const fileInput = document.getElementById('file-input');
const uploadButton = document.getElementById('upload-button');

uploadButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const file = fileInput.files[0];

  // Create a new Tus upload using the Fetch API
  const response = await fetch('/uploads/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Upload-Length': file.size.toString(),
    },
    body: file,
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    console.error('Error uploading file:', response.statusText);
    return;
  }

  console.log('File uploaded successfully!');
});
In this example, fileInput and uploadButton are references to the file input and upload button elements in the React component. When the upload button is clicked, the code creates a new Tus upload using the fetch API.

The headers object is used to set the Upload-Length header to the size of the file being uploaded. The body property is set to the file object.

If the response from the server is not ok, an error message is logged to the console. Otherwise, a success message is logged.

Note that this example assumes that the server will be handling the file upload using the aiohttp_tus library, as shown in the previous example.

Node.js API with tus.


Ashwini CM
Api in nodejs with tus to handle file

To create an API in Node.js with tus to handle file uploads, you can follow these steps:

Install the tus-node-server package using npm:
Copy code
npm install tus-node-server
Create a new Node.js file and import the necessary modules:
javascript
Copy code
const tus = require('tus-node-server');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
Set up the tus server configuration:
javascript
Copy code
const server = new tus.Server();
server.datastore = new tus.FileStore({
  path: '/files'
});
Here we create a new tus server and set the datastore to a new FileStore instance with a path of /files which will store uploaded files in the /files directory.

Set up the tus server endpoint:
javascript
Copy code
app.all('/files/*', (req, res) => {
  server.handle(req, res);
});
Here we create an endpoint that matches all requests to /files/* and passes them to the tus server's handle method.

Start the server:
javascript
Copy code
const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
});
This starts the server on port 8080 and logs a message to the console when it starts.

Your final code should look something like this:

javascript
Copy code
const tus = require('tus-node-server');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const server = new tus.Server();
server.datastore = new tus.FileStore({
  path: '/files'
});

app.all('/files/*', (req, res) => {
  server.handle(req, res);
});

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
});
With this set up, you can now upload files to your API using tus client libraries or the tus-js-client package.
